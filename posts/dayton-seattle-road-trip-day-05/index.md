**Day 5: Arlington, TX -> Abilene, TX**

**Miles driven: 210.3 (total: 1339.7)**


## Summary

Started off the morning by snagging a quick pic with Brian before he went to work and I went to a coffee shop for breakfast + free wifi.

Eventually I headed to Downtown Dallas to check out some historical sites, including the location of the JFK assassination, the JFK memorial, and Pioneer Plaza with the Cattle Drive Sculptures. The summer I was in Kansas (2020) I learned about its history as the end of the Cattle Drive, so it was cool to see the other end of the line in Texas.

Afterwards, I continued on to Abilene, TX. Towards the end of the drive, a cash register in Taco Casa stood out to me; I thought it was rather serendipitous that it was made by National Cash Register (founded in Dayton, my trip's starting point) and running the Windows operating system (developed by Microsoft in Redmond, my trip's final destination).
