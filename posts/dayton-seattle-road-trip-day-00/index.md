## Summary

The plan: Just like I did a [trip after after graduating high school](https://www.trailjournals.com/adventurousreflection), I'm doing a trip after graduating college, but this time driving instead of backpacking. I'm headed to Seattle for a security research job with Microsoft, and plan to hit as many National Parks in the Southwest U.S. along the way as I can.
