**Day 9: Motel 6 in El Paso, TX -> BLM land near Alamogordo, NM**

**Miles driven: 101.5 (total: 1936.8)**


## Summary

Today was mostly a recovery and planning day. With a real bed and strong air conditioner, I slept in late this morning. I did another round of laundry while in El Paso before heading to a sandwich shop to use the wifi for blog posts and making 4th of July plans. Eventually I drove to a spot in the barren desert near the town of Alamogordo. Several Merriam's kangaroo rats (I think?) rustled in the bushes around me as I set up my campsite at dusk.
