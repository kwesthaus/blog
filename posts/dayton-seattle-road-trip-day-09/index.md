**Day 9: Motel 6 in El Paso, TX -> BLM land near Alamogordo, NM**

**Miles driven: 101.5 (total: 1936.8)**


## Summary

Today was mostly a recovery and planning day. In a greater sense, I think that's the main reason I'm on this trip; not to visit a bunch of national parks or see our beautiful country (though those are strong secondary reasons), but to recover from college and prepare myself for the next phase of life. While the experience of college was a blast and I'll miss it dearly, the actual school aspect left me burnt out. One month of going wherever I want and sleeping under the stars, despite many days of feeling dusty, stinky, and sweaty, is just what I need to feel rejuvenated.

With a real bed and strong air conditioner, I slept in late this morning. I did another round of laundry while in El Paso before heading to a sandwich shop to use the wifi for blog posts and making 4th of July plans. Eventually I drove to a spot in the barren desert near the town of Alamogordo. Several Merriam's kangaroo rats (I think?) rustled in the bushes around me as I set up my campsite at dusk.
