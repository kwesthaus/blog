**Day 2: Nashville, TN -> Lake Ouachita, AR**

**Miles driven: 432.1 (total: 745.0)**


## Summary

I tried to sleep in my car last night and failed, it was way too hot. I saw the Parthenon and "I Believe in Nashville" Mural before leaving town, then pretty much booked it the rest of the day. Before making it to my first new state (Arkansas!), I stopped in to Central BBQ in Memphis to see how it compares to the barbecue I've had in Kansas City and elsewhere.
