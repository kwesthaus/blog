**Day 3: Lake Ouachita, AR -> Dierks Lake, AR**

**Miles driven: 89.4 (total: 834.4)**


## Summary

Last night I pulled into the campsite late and set up my hammock. I slept 100x better than the night before and it turned out be a beautiful spot the next morning. I then drove into Hot Springs to see my first National Park of the trip! I enjoyed the beautiful architecture on Bathhouse Row and the grand view from Hot Springs Mountain.

One of the most enjoyable parts of this trip is the complete flexibility I have, with no solid plans until July 26th. However, the flexibility comes with the challenge of finding a place to stay every night "on the fly". I spent some time familiarizing myself with different resources for campsites around the U.S. to hopefully reduce the amount of time I need to spend figuring this out in future days.
