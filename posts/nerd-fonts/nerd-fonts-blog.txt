-  most common terms font awesome and nerd fonts. font awesome is only one set of icons that is included in nerd fonts
- nerd fonts provides patched versions of common fonts which include the proper icon glyphs in the fonts themselves. so need to use "$FONTNAME Nerd Font" as opposed to just "$FONTNAME" in config files
    - AUR package nerd-fonts-complete for all or packages for each individual font family (e.g. nerd-fonts-iosevka)
- alternatively, fontconfig already provides mechanisms to use fallback fonts when glyphs aren't found, so you can use a regular font but ALSO have installed a font specifically for the icons that the normal font doesn't have glyphs for
    - ttf-font-awesome (or otf-font-awesome, just a different font file format)
    - ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols
    - ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols-mono
        - /usr/share/fontconfig/conf.avail/10- (some nerd font name) controls this I think? but how does it work with ttf-font-awesome?
- most special font glyphs are wide, so the monospace versions of the glyphs are necessarily tiny. however, many things (programs? renderers? I'm not sure what's responsbile here) render the wide versions incorrectly. so you have to choose between tiny icons (monospace fonts), overlapping glyphs (regular fonts), or manually patching whatever program is generating the text to include a space after each icon glyph (i3wsr in my case)
    - note for demos, use bin/scripts/lib/i_all.sh from nerd fonts repo (ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)
    - echo "$i_linux_archlinux"after
        - terminal configured for monospace font, shows up correctly but tiny
        - terminal configured for regular font, shows up large but overlaps "a" character in after
    - show screenshots from my system
    - other helpful command: fc-list

something is seriously wrong with the discord icon. I one I currently use only shows up if ttf-font-awesome is installed (otherwise it just outputs the unsupported unicode character rectangle). the one output with `echo $i_mdi_discord` shows up regardless of ttf-font-awesome, but appears before the workspace number!
